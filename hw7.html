<h3>I created a choropleth map illustrating the mean level of exposure to PM2.5, or inhalable particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers, for each country in 2020. The CSV dataset I used, downloaded from the
    Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development, provided the data in micrgrams per meters squared. An obstacle I ran into while joining my datasets were discrepencies in country naming. In order to remedy this,
    I cleaned my CSV, making sure the country names matched the vector of the globe. I used the natural breaks ratio; in this case, it gave the clearest picture of the data, utilizing the full range of the gradient.
